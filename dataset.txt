The reason I picked this dataset is because it is similar to the example of ice formation trends that the professor showed us in class.
Another reason I chose to use this dataset is because it is large enough to where I can pick specific locations and show the trends
comparing various locations within Australia. I would create three visualization that show the trends of annual rainfall n Australia.
I would first do this by creating a scatterplot to represent the data of Australia as a whole. Then I would compare the data showing
the gaps between the rainiest days and the driest days. For me to represent those gaps I would create a line graph showing the trends.
I could also compare the gaps between the hottest and coldest days within the data. Along with this dataset I could compare Aremax wind
speed and show the trends of where it gets stronger or where it is weaker. For me to show the tends I could create an area graph, a pie chart, or even a histogram.
